    <h1>Emojis in HTML</h1>

    <p>
        Let us understand what emojis are. <br>
        Emojis are letters or characters from the <b>UTF-8 (Unicode)</b> character set. They look like images or icons, but they are not. <br> <br>
        <b>UTF-8</b> covers almost all of the characters and symbols in the world. <br> <br>
        In order to display an HTML page correctly, a web browser must know the character set used in the page and this is specified in the <b>meta</b> tag, with the <b>charset</b> attribute and the value of it as <b>UTF-8</b>. If we don't specify the <b>meta characterset</b>, <b>UTF-8</b> is the default character set in HTML.
    </p>

    <p>
        If you know what <b>ASCII</b> codes are, then we can understand the UTF-8 better. If you don't understand ASCII, please read about it once. <br>
        <b>UTF-8 is a method of encoding Unicode that also begins with the complete ASCII range. So, ASCII is a subset of Unicode as well as a subset of UTF-8
        </b>
    </p>

    <h2>UTF-8 Characters</h2>

    <p>
        Many UTF-8 characters cannot be typed on a keyboard, but they can always be displayed using numbers (called entity numbers): <br>
        <ul>
            <li>A is 65</li>
            <li>B is 66</li>
            <li>C is 67</li>
        </ul>
    </p>

    <p>
        To let the browser understand that we want to display a character, we must start the entity number with <b>&#</b> and end it with <b>;</b> (semicolon).
    </p>

    <h2>Emoji Characters</h2>

    <p>
        Here is an example of the codes for different emojis which need to be written starting with the <b>&#</b> and ending with the <b>;</b> .<br>
        <ul>
            <li>üòÑ is 128516</li>
            <li>üòç is 128525</li>
            <li>üíó is 128151</li>
        </ul>

        <br><br>
        Since the emojis are also characters, they can also be copied, pasted, displayed and sized just like any other character in HTML.
