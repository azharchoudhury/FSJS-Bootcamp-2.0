    <h1>Paragraphs in HTML</h1>
    <p>We can write anything using the paragraph tag </p>

    <p>This is a paragraph. Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet consectetur adipisicing elit. Tenetur quidem, aut, mollitia, recusandae minus voluptate reiciendis repellat vero consectetur nesciunt nostrum praesentium doloribus vel dignissimos alias possimus sunt eveniet quia ab a tempore quae iste fugiat architecto. Nemo, nobis voluptatibus?</p>

    <p>This is another paragraph. Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet consectetur adipisicing elit. Beatae libero aliquam eos optio et. Rem quod quam facilis voluptatibus nostrum?</p>

<h2>Horizontal Rules</h2>

<p>We can add a horizontal line with the hr element. It is generally used to seperate contents in a webpage. Below is an example of the hr element. It is an empty element which doesn't require any closing tag.</p>

<hr>

We can add as many horizontal lines as we want.

<hr><hr><hr><hr>

<h2>Line Breaks</h2>

<p>Now we will see about line breaks. What happens in HTML is that if we want to go to the next line, even if we hit the enter key and write something on a new line in the HTML document, it will appear in a new line in the HTML document, but, in the browser it will still start from the same line only. So, for going to the next line we have the line break tag. Let us see an example with the br element</p>

<p>This is the first line that I am writing now. 
    This won't go to the next line even though I hit the enter key still it won't be in the next line. <br> And now this is the third sentence but written in the same line. I haven't hit the <b>Enter</b> key rather I used the <b>br</b> element after the first sentence and I am still writing in the same line. <br> So, while we use the <b>br</b> element, we need not hit the enter key and start writing on a new line. <br> We can just put the br element after the completion of a sentence.</p>

<h2>Pre tag</h2>
<p>         
In some cases, we might want to write something in the HTML and would like to display it in the same manner as it was written, for example, a poem. So, if we write it in a paragraph, there won't be any new lines and for putting a new line, we need to enter the br element. <br> So, to solve this problem, we have an element named as pre element. With this element, if we want to display something on the webpage in the way we see it on the HTML document, we can use this element. <br> Let us see how it works. </p>

<strong>“Hesitations Outside the Door” by Margaret Atwood</strong>

I’m telling the wrong lies,
they are not even useful.

The right lies would at least
be keys, they would open the door.

The door is closed; the chairs,
the tables, the steel bowl, myself

shaping bread in the kitchen, wait
outside it.
