    <h1>Text Formatting in HTML</h1>

    <h2>Bold and Strong elements</h2>

    <p>The <b>bold</b> and the <b>strong</b> elements look the same when applied to any text in HTML. But, they don't
        have the same significance. Let us understand it more elaborately.</p>

    <p>The <b>bold</b> element, which is written with the <b>b</b> tag just makes the text look <b>bold</b> and draws
        the attention. It just functions visually and doesn't have any more significance than this. It is just used for
        styling which we can do better with CSS and are supposed to do all the styling with CSS only.</p>

    <p>The <strong>strong</strong> element, which is written with the <b>strong</b> tag, on the other hand has a
        semantic function. It looks the same as the bold element visually, but it tells the browser that the text
        labelled as strong has strong importance. It also helps in accessibility for visually impaired people.</p>

    <h2>Italics and Emphasis elements</h2>

    <p>The <b><i>italic</i></b> element which is written with the <b>i</b> tag again works just like the <b>b</b>
        element. The <b>i</b> element doesn't have any significance other than styling texts in italics. </p>

    <p>The <b><em>emphasis</em></b> element, which is written with the <b><em>em</em></b> tag, on the other hand has a
        semantic function like the <b>strong</b> tag. It is used to define emphasized text. The content inside the
        <b><em>em</em></b> tag is displayed in <b>italic</b> by default.</p>

    <h2>Small element</h2>
    <p>The <b>small</b> element makes the text smaller relative to the size it was before using the tag. It generally
        represents side-comments and small print, like copyright and legal text. <br> For example - <small>This sentence
            is written within the small tags</small> <br> <small><b>Note: We don't use this for styling rather we use
                CSS for all the styling of texts.</b></small></p>

    <h2>Big element</h2>
    <p>The <b>big</b> element makes the text larger relative to the size it was before using the tag. This is actually
        deprecated and is not encouraged to use in HTML as we do the styling of texts with CSS. But, for information, I
        have put it along with the explanation of the <b>small</b> element. <br>For example - <big>This sentence is written
            within the <b>big</b> tags</big> </p>

    <h2>Mark element</h2>

    <p>The <b>mark</b> element defines that the text written with the mark tags should be marked or highlighted. Again,
        we don't need to do this with the mark element rather we can use <b>span</b> in CSS for highlighting or marking
        texts. <br> For example - <mark>People with valid ID proof only shall be allowed to enter the premise.</mark>
    </p>


    <h2>Insert element</h2>

    <p>The <b>insert</b> element, which is written with the <b>ins</b> tag, defines that the text enclosed within the
        <b>ins</b> tags have been inserted into a document. It underlines the text within the <b>ins</b> tags but it is a
        semantic tag and is not just used for underlining texts. <br>For example - The missing word <ins>required</ins>
        has been successfully inserted into the file.</p>

    <h2>Underline element</h2>

    <p>The <b>underline</b> element, which is written within the <b>u</b> tags, has been deprecated and is discouraged
        to use for underlining texts. We should use CSS for underlining texts. <br>For example - This is a
        <u>precious</u> gift from him.</p>


    <h2>Delete element</h2>

    <p>The <b>delete</b> element, which is written within the <b>del</b> tags, defines that the text has been deleted
        from a document. The browser strikes a line through the texts enclosed within the <b>del</b> tags. This is a
        semantic tag and should not be used for styling purposes such as strikethrough a text. <br>For example - The
        captain of the team is <del>Hrithik</del> Vivek.</p>

    <h2>Subscript element</h2>

    <p>The <b>subscript</b> element, which is written within the <b>sub</b> tags, specifies the text enclosed within the
        <b>sub</b> tags should be displayed as subscript and should only be used for typographical reasons only rather
        than styling or appearance purposes. <br> For example - H<sub>2</sub>0 + CO<sub>2</sub> --->
        H<sub>2</sub>CO<sub>3</sub></p>


    <h2>Superscript element</h2>

    <p>The <b>superscript</b> element, which is written within the <b>sup</b> tags, specifies the text enclosed within
        the <b>sup</b> tags should be displayed as superscript and should only be used for typographical reasons only
        rather than styling or appearance purposes. <br> For example - 4<sup>2</sup> = 16</p>

    <h2>Block Quotation element</h2>
    <p>The blockquote tag in HTML is used to display long quotations that is, a section which is quoted from another
        source. It changes the alignment of the text enclosed within the <b>blockquote</b> tags to make it unique from
        others. It contains both opening and closing tags. We can use elements like heading, list, paragraph and others
        inside the <b>blockquote</b> tag <br> It has an attribute called <b>cite</b> which is used to specify the source
        of the quotation. <br> The value of the <b>cite</b> attribute is <b>URL</b> which specifies the source of the
        quotation. <br> There are two possible values of the <b>URL :</b> <br>
        <ul>
            <li><b>absolute URL :</b> It points to another website.</li>
            <li><b>relative URL :</b> It points to a file within a website.</li>
        </ul>
        <br> Example of block quotation -
        <br>
        <blockquote cite="https://opensource.google/">
            <p>

    </p>

    <h2>Inline Quotation element</h2>

    <p>The <b>inline quotation element</b>, which is written by using the <b>q</b> tag, indicates that the enclosed text
        is a short inline quotation. <br> Most of the modern browsers implement this by surrounding the text in
        quotation marks. This element is actually used for short quotations only that don't require paragraph breaks;
        for long quotations, we should use the <b>blockquote</b> element.
        <br>For example - <br> <q>In order to write about life first you must live it.</q>– Ernest Hemingway
    </p>


    <h2>Address element</h2>

    <p>The <b>address</b> element, which is written within the <b>address</b> tags, defines the contact information of
        the author or the owner of a document or an article. <br> The contact information can be an email address, URL,
        physical address, phone number, social media handle etc. <br>The text in the <b>address</b> element usually
        renders in <em>italic</em>, and browsers will always add a line break before and after the <b>address</b>
        element.
        <br> For example - <br>
        <address>
            Written by - Azhar Choudhury. <br>
            Contact - <br>
            <a href="azharmehmud11@gmail.com">azharmehmud11@gmail.com</a> <br>
            <a href="7002712345">7002712345</a>
        </address>
    </p>

    <h2>Cite element</h2>

    <p>The <b>cite</b> element, which is written within the <b>cite</b> tags, is used to define the title of a work.
        <br> It displays the text in italics. <br> For example - <cite>Introduction to Web and HTML</cite></p>

    <h2>Bi-Directional Override (bdo)</h2>

    <p>The <b>Bi-directional Override (bdo)</b> element overrides the current direction of the text written, so that the
        text within the <b>bdo</b> tags is rendered in a different direction. <br>
        For example - Coding -> <bdo dir="rtl">Coding</bdo>
    </p>
