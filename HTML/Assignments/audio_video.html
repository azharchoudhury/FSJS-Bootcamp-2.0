    <h1>Audio and Video in HTML</h1>

    <h2>Audio</h2>
    <p>
        The <b>audio</b> element is used to embed sound content or audio files in HTML documents. <br>
        We need to put the source of the audio file with the <b>src</b> attribute.

        But, if we only use the <b>audio</b> tags and put the source of the audio file, we will still not be able to see
        anything on the browser. The audio file will be loaded but there won't be anything visible. <br>
        For playing the audio and controlling the audio file, we need to put another attribute with the <b>audio</b>
        tag.
        Let us see some useful attributes of the <b>audio</b> tag.
    </p>

    <h3>controls</h2>

        <p>
            The <b>controls</b> attribute allows the user to see the controls offered by the browser to control audio
            playback, control the volume, seek, and pause or resume the playback.
        </p>

        <h3>muted</h2>

            <p>
                The <b>muted</b> attribute mutes the audio by default when the page loads. This is applied because some
                users do not want the audio to be played automatically when the page loads. So, with the <b>muted</b>
                attribute, the audio won't play when the browser loads the page and allows the user to unmute and listen
                to the audio.

                <br>

                The text between the <b>audio</b> tags will only be displayed in browsers that do not support the
                <b>audio</b> element.


            </p>

            <p>Here is an audio which you can play and listen to üëáüèª</p>

            <div style="text-align: center;">
                <!-- <audio src="./05 Nazar Laaye.mp3" controls>Listen to Nazar Laaye</audio> -->

                <audio controls autoplay muted>
                    <source src="./05 Nazar Laaye.mp3">
                </audio>

            </div>

            <br><br>

            <h2>Video</h2>

            <p>
                The <b>video</b> element allows the developer to embed a media player which supports video playback in
                the document such as a movie clip or music video or tutorial or any other video streams.. <br><br>

                The <b>video</b> tag needs the <b>src</b> attribute to get the source of the video file. The source can
                be a file in the local storage or the link of a video on the web.

                The text between the <b>video</b> tags will only be displayed in browsers that do not support the
                <b>video</b> element.

            </p>

            <p>Let us look at a video clip added with the <b>video</b> tags üëáüèª</p>

            <div style="text-align: center;">

                <video controls autoplay muted width="600px" height="400px">
                    <source src="./pexels-sevie-7125268.mp4" type="video/mp4">
                </video>

            </div>

            <br><br>

            <p>
                <b>Remember: </b> The <b>autoplay</b> doesn't work with some browsers if the audio or video is not
                <b>muted</b>. <br>
                Because browsers have now become smarter and know that if the audio or video is unmuted, auto-playing
                the audio/video might cause bad user experience. <br>
                So, the <b>autoplay</b> works when the <b>muted</b> attribute is applied on the <b>audio/video</b> as it
                knows that playing the video without the audio might not give the user an unpleasant experience.
            </p>
